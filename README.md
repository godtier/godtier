<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hello. My name is Ian.</h3>

I'm interested in front end web and application development with Javascript. I am a huge fan of PowerShell and Python for sysAdmin task automation. Currently I am working on my SQL skills with Udemy courses. This is mostly for learning and messing around, but constructive criticism is welcome. I can be reached at <email>ian@godtier.net</email>.
